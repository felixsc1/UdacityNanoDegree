# Projects:

## 1. Finding Donors for CharityML
Evaluated and optimized several different supervised learners to optimize the donation yield of a fictious charity. The donors with the highest potential donation yield were selected in order to reduce the total numbers of letters being sent.

## 2. Image Classifier with Deep Learning
Implemented an image classifier with PyTorch. The notebook or command line program was trained on a large dataset of flower images and is able to recognize over one hundred species and assing the correct label to a new image.

## 3. Identify Customer Segments
Using a real-life dataset representing German demographic information, I used unsupervised learning techniques to summarize and cluster unlabeled data into groups with similar properties. These groups were then compared to the customers of a mail-order company in order to determine which specific segments are represented in the customer base.
